# Rock Paper Scissors with Upgrades

This project is a modern and responsive take on the classic **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game. It runs entirely in the browser and can be hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Classic gameplay** with Rock, Paper and Scissors.
- **Durability system** – each weapon can only be used three times. When its counter reaches zero, it becomes disabled.
- **New weapons** – every third round, you can unlock additional weapons such as **Fire** and **Air**. Fire beats Paper and Scissors, but is beaten by Rock and Air. Air beats Fire and Paper, but loses to Rock and Scissors.
- **Animations** – battle icons shake and pop when a winner is determined, enhancing the visual feedback.
- **Responsive design** – the game adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox and media queries.

## How to Play

1. Choose your weapon: Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, or Scissors ✂️.
2. Each weapon can be used up to 3 times. After that, it will be disabled.
3. Every third round, you can unlock a new weapon (Fire 🔥 or Air 💨) to add to your choices.
4. The computer will randomly choose its weapon, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.
5. Score is updated after each round, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins!
