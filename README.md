# Rock Paper Scissors with Upgrades

This project is a modern and responsive take on the classic **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game. It runs entirely in the browser and can be hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Classic gameplay** with Rock, Paper and Scissors.
- **Durability system** – each weapon can only be used three times. When its counter reaches zero, it becomes disabled.
- **New weapons** – every third round, you can unlock additional weapons such as **Fire** and **Air**. Fire beats Paper and Scissors, but is beaten by Rock and Air. Air beats Fire and Paper, but loses to Rock and Scissors.
- **Animations** – battle icons shake and pop when a winner is determined, enhancing the visual feedback.
- **Responsive design** – the game adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox and media queries.
